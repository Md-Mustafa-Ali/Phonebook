#Rentomojo - Backend 

##Develop a phonebook service which will store the following information about a contact:

● Name of the contact (Required field)
● Phone number (Optional field)
● Email address (Required field) - Each contact must have a unique email address.
The phonebook app should expose APIs supporting the following functionalities:
● Adding a contact
● Modifying an existing contact
● Deleting a contact
● Get all contacts (10 contacts per page by default)
● Search a contact by name or email address (10 results per page by default)
● Basic authentication for each API endpoint (the authentication token should be read from
the environment variable and should NOT be hardcoded in the code)
Deploy the code on Heroku/GCP/AWS or any hosting service of your choice.
Push your code on GitHub.
